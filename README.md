freebsd-jail-host
=========

This role is used to create a FreeBSD system which in turn may be used to host one or more jails.
There are roles for jails which may be used in combination with this one to create a jailed www, db, or mail server. You may combine those jails as you wish to create a server that may host a bunch of wordpress installations,a single mail server, or both.

See [my other project](https://github.com/JoergFiedler/freebsd-ansible-demo) for further information and how to use it.

Requirements
